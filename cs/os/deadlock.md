# Deadlock

A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 

Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously:
- Mutual exclusion
- Hold and wait
- No preemption
- Circular wait
